--- changelog format change ---

1999-19-02 (16:42) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* dsp.c: Included gtick.h... Eeek.. 
	
	* main.c: If /dev/dsp is busy or not available exit the program!

1999-19-02 (15:43) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* mixer.c: Added /dev/mixer code. Mostly taken from GMix and the 
	  mixer_applet from Gnome-Core.
	
	* main.c: Connected Volume slider to the mixer update callback.
	
	* main.c: Moved sound system initialisation to before UI init..
	  so we can set the slider to the inital PCM volume..
	
1999-19-02 (14:32) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* main.c: Added Volume slider/label.. Doesn't vary volume yet..
	  PCM Volume would be the best volume to vary though.. I guess..
	
1999-19-02 (14:04) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* about.c: Added new About box.. for no reason other than it's a
	  fun (yet pointless) addition..

1999-19-02 (13:22) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gtick.h: removed gtSetDSPRate(..).. it was never needed..
	  Hrmm.. "gint count" wasn't in the gtDSPTick function declaration,
	  it shouldn't have compiled! but it did!
	
	* dsp.c: On Normal timing, use the longer tone...
	
	* Makefile: Added "dist" target, to build the gTick distro..
	
	* 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2

1999-17-02 (14:37) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* dsp.c: Make sure timing count doesn't go over the time chosen..
	
1999-17-02 (12:51) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Makefile: We're debugging, so include DEBUG symbols. And the
	  VERSION definition should be in $CFLAGS..

	* dsp.c: Implemented normal, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 timeing in the gtDSPTick, 
	  output function. Requires an arg. of 1, 2, 3 or 4; for the
	  respective output.

	* main.c: Implemented Radio Buttons for timeing. The timeout callback
	  now works out which radio button is active, and sends the correct
	  signal to gtDSPTick.

1999-16-02 (22:10) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* dsp.c: Implemented first version of a Tick-Tock-Tick-Tock type of 
	  alternating output, for different timings..
	
1999-16-02 (16:50) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* *.c: Tidied up code.
	
1999-16-02 (13:32) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gtick.h:
	  main.c: Added Timing radio buttons (2/4, 3/4, etc).. Now I have to
	  actually implement the buttons..

1999-14-02 (23:03) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* main.c: Fixed compile warnings.. gtk_signal_connect instead of
	  gtk_signal_connect_object.. it was segfaulting before because i
	  wasnt referencing the correct pointer setup..
	  
	* dsp.c: Changed output rate from 16kHz to 44.1kHz, now tempo really
	  does vary from 30bpm to 250bpm (and it does it proprely)
	  
	* Makefile: version 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1

1999-14-02 (20:00) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* dsp.c: Added FreeBSD compatibility.. thanks to Kain

1999-14-02 (19:42) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* *.[ch]: Added GPL Licence.. Time for a release, methinks...

	* dsp.c: Removed old depreciated function..

1999-14-02 (18:11) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* dsp.c: Changed output format to Signed 16bit Little Endian and output
	  rate to 22.05kHz.. with a duration of 256 (however long that is in ms),
	  all is fantastic..
	  
	* Makefile: 0.0.3 -> 0.1.0

1999-14-02 (16:47) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* main.c: Added signal callback for an adjustment change.. Changes
	  the BPM rate interval for the timeout. If the timeout is running, it
	  stops it before changing the rate then restarts.
	  Also, moved the interval code from gtBeat to gtUpdateRate, which is
	  the new signal callback.
	
	* Makefile: Upped version no. to 0.0.3.. 

1999-14-02 (16:30) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* main.c: Thanks to Kain (dalnet/#linuxos) the timeout interval can be
	  easily changed, with the nifty formula (see NOTES)..
	
1999-14-02 (15:04) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* main.c: Added gtk_timeout functions for metronome output..
	  the timeout frequencies are weird.. just gotta make the DSP output
	  sound like it does in the dsp.c test program (-DTEST_DSP)..

1999-14-02 (13:36) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* dsp.c: Implemented BPM to DSP Rate interface, see NOTES for the
	  magic numbers required :]

1999-13-02 (21:56) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added frame around BPM scale slider
	  Makes it look a lot nicer
	
	* BPM slider modified to go 50 to 250, with 75 as the default
	
	* Started Log

--- the following is an excerpt of the old NEWS file by Alex Roberts: ---

0.1.2 -> 0.1.3

	* Implemented variable output volume (using /dev/mixer and
	  the PCM output, which /dev/dsp uses).
	  (Much of this code was taken from Gmix and the Gnome-Panel 
	  mixer_applet).
	
	* Public release of 0.1.3

0.1.1 -> 0.1.2

	* Tidied up code 

	* Added 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 timings
	
	* Put longer duration back as the normal output (How it got
	  changed to the shorter duration I have no idea.. it was at
	  64 instead of 256.. no wonder people have problems with the
	  0.1.1 release!)

0.1.0 -> 0.1.1

	* Modifications to /dev/dsp, set output to 44.1kHz

	* First public release (0.1.1)

0.0.3 -> 0.1.0

	* Implemented variable BPM
	
	* Implemented /dev/dsp
	
	* Various bug fixes

0.0.1 -> 0.0.3
	
	* First developments..

	* Developed interface
